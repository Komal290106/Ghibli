#  Studio Ghibli Inspired Website

I love Studio Ghibli movies, so I wanted to create something simple yet magical dedicated to them.  
This project is a **static website** built entirely with **HTML and CSS** — no frameworks, no JavaScript, just pure creativity and styling.

Studio Ghibli films always remind me to slow down and enjoy the small details in life.  
This project was my way of capturing a bit of that magic .
